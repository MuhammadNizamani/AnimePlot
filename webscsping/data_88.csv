Cecelia, a kind young girl, is tasked to fulfill this role; however, this tiresome job quickly exhausts her. That, paired with her hidden somnolent nature, often causes her to laze around the church. This leaves Lawrence to care for the church all by himself. While Cecelia sleeps in anticipation for her next visitor, Lawrence caters to her needs alongside performing the church's numerous responsibilities.Slowly but surely, they begin to form a comfortable and trusting friendship with one another.
